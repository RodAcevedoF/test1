# My First GitHub Repo ðŸš€

Welcome to my very first repository, created entirely from the terminal using Git and the GitHub CLI!

## What's Inside

- **`index.html`**: A simple HTML file with a link. (Nothing fancy, but it was a big step for me!)

## How I Created This Repo

I practiced my Git and GitHub CLI skills with the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Stage all files
git add ./

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create a new public repo on GitHub using the GitHub CLI
gh repo create NOMBRE --public

# Link the local repo to the remote GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/RodAcevedoF/NOMBRE.git

# Push the master branch to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RodAcevedoF/NOMBRE.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the simple link page.

## Why This Matters

Even a small project like this taught me:

- Basic Git workflows (init, add, commit, push).
- Using the GitHub CLI (`gh repo create`).
- Working comfortably with the terminal.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
